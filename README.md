# Selenium-Scrape
Scraping every item on Amazon Best Seller page and record its SKU, Item Title, Amazon Price using Selenium package on Python

# Why Selenium 
I've tried using the Request, lxml, BeautifuSoup and Scrapy package but because the elements on the Amazon web constantly changes (xpath is not always the same) in different categories and typos that occurs here and there, Selenium is ultimately the best option as it provides the bare view of the web page as oppose to bare lxml codes
