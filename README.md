# Selenium-Scrape
Scraping every item on Amazon Best Seller page and record its SKU, Item Title, Amazon Price using Selenium package on Python

# Inspiration
This script is created to make further analysis on tracking which sort of Amazon listings will perform equally when listed on eBay platform 

# Why Selenium 
I've tried using the Request, lxml, BeautifuSoup and Scrapy package but because the elements on the Amazon web constantly changes (xpath is not always the same) in different categories and typos that occurs here and there. Selenium is ultimately the best option as it provides view of the web page as oppose to bare lxml codes

# Chromedriver
Chrome driver is required to be downloaded before running code
